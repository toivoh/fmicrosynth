Example instruments for FMicrosynth
===================================
This directory contains a number of samples generated by `instruments.jl` in [../julia/](../julia/).
* All samples except `sinewave.wav` are generated using the bit exact `simulator.jl`.
	* `sine-approx.wav` is a sine wave generated using FMicrosynth's sine approximation. `sinewave.wav` is an actual sine wave for comparison.
* Most samples are generated using a simple two-operator FM patch (10 instructions).
	* `hihat.wav` uses a noise waveform instead.
	* `snare.wav` uses a noise waveform and a two-operator FM patch.
* Most of the FM patches use the `sin` instruction for the carrier and modulator waveforms, but some use the `sina2` and/or `triangle` instructions for the carrier and/or modulator, which can be seen as lower order sine approximations, with stronger harmonics.

Some of the instruments were adapted from "Music: A Mathematical Offering" by Dave Benson, chapter 8.12.
